# Myop environment setup

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/hackteck/myop-setup/tree/master)

*This is not thoroughly battle‑tested yet, but it should work. If it doesn’t – congratulations, you found a new edge case.*

## Prerequisites
- Sign in to your GitHub account or [create one](https://github.com) if you don't already have one.
- Create an account at [myop.dev](https://myop.dev) if you don't have one yet. If you need to be added to the organization, kindly ask [hadar@myop.dev](mailto:hadar@myop.dev).
- Install [Myop Dev Extension](https://docs.myop.dev/docs/dev-extension/)
- Optional: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for better expirience

## Setup
- Click the curly black "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button above to let GitHub set up the required environment.
- Wait until the Codespace finishes provisioning (this is the "take a 5‑minute break" step).
- In the Codespace, click the orange Claude Code icon at the top right to open Claude Code. Choose **claude.ai Subscription** and follow the instructions to log in.
- In the VS Code Claude prompt, type `/mcp` and select **Manage MCP servers**. Authorize the Myop MCP. During this process you may need to log in to both Claude and Myop, hit *Enter* a few times, and approve the connection prompts. The defaults are usually correct – just keep confirming.
- For a more convenient workflow, go to <https://github.com/codespaces>, find your Codespace, click the three‑dot menu, and choose **Open in Visual Studio Code**. Make sure VS Code is installed. Tip: you can go to [codespaces settings](https://github.com/settings/codespaces) and change *Editor preference* from **Visual Studio Code for the Web** to **Visual Studio Code**
